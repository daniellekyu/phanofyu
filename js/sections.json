The part of the story that Danielle likes to mention is that Minh popped out of a bush with his pick-up line “Hey, do you know where I can find parking?” It turns out that both of our friends decided to have a joint birthday party together and each friend invited us. We struck up a conversation at the party and kept in touch. A few months later Minh asked Danielle out on their first date and the rest, as they say, is history."
